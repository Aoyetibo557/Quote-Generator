#Quote-Generator This program uses an API sourced from RAPIDAPI's to generate random quotes. There is a cap to the Number of calls permited per day, before a charge of $0.5 for every API call. Later Modification: Use key words for specific search.

To run this program you need a VSC with a live server extension.
